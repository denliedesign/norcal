                    We have weekly Tumbling classes for ages 3 and up as well as non-affiliated cheer and hip hop teams for ages 4-18.
                    <br>
                    Interested in enrolling in our weekly classes beginning August 3?

                    <span class="big-gold-text rounded-manual">What are non-affiliated Cheer and Hip Hop teams?</span>
                    <br>
                    A non-affiliated cheer and hip hop team does not represent a sports team and is not an “all-star” team.
                    <br><br>
                    What are the benefits of joining an unaffiliated team vs an all-star or sports affiliated team?
                    <br>
                    A non-affiliated team is half the cost of an all-star team (with all-star level training)  and the season runs from August-January instead of year-round. Less commitment, half the cost, all the fun!
                    <br><br>
                    What to bring for evaluations
                    <br>
                    Everyone makes a team!
                    <br>
                    Athletes must wear form-fitting clothing that will not impede tumbling or stunting skills.  Please have hair pulled back and bring water.
                    <br><br>
