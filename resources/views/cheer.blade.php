                        <strong>What are cheer classes?</strong>
                        <br>
                        Learn the basics.  Cheer classes are great for new athletes.  We will teach cheer motions, jumps, and basic stunting (how to base, fly or back spot)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What do they do in class?</strong>
                        <br>
                        Our classes begin with a proper warm up to protect our athletesâ€™ bodies.  Then we teach and develop body positions, jumps and stunts according to the ability level of the athletes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Do they learn a routine?</strong>
                        <br>
                        Yes they learn a routine and have the opportunity to participate in multiple showcases during the year.
